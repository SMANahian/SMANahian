# Hello Everyone! 👋

<p>
Hello! I'm S M A Nahian. 
I am from Bangladesh. 
I am <strong>19</strong> years old. 
I am now an undergraduate at <strong>MIT (Class of 2029)</strong>.
<br />
<br />
I am a Math enthusiast. 
Beside my academic studies, I love to solve Mathematical Olympiad problems. 
Among the four major topics in MO, I like Geometry and Combinatorics (also good at these maybe :p) and I hate NT (obviously because I am weak at this). 
I have been participating in BdMO (Bangladesh Mathematical Olympiad) since I was 10 years old. 
I've participated in some International MO's too. 
Till now, my biggest achievements in MO are getting 2x Bronze medals at <a href="https://www.imo-official.org/participant_r.aspx?id=31878"> International Mathematics Olympiad </a> & 2x Silver medals at <a href="https://www.apmo-official.org/country_report/BGD/all"> Asian Pacific Mathematics Olympiad </a>. 
<br />
<br />
I also like to code. 
I am a beginner at competitive programming, but I am trying to improve. 
Mainly, I started competitive programming to improve my combinatorics skill, but now I do it because I liked it.

I have ranked #210 at the Asia-Pacific Informatics Olympiad 2024.
I use C++, Python and Java for cp. 
Besides competitive programming, I am learning web application development.
