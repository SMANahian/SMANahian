# Hello Everyone! ðŸ‘‹

<p>
    I'm S.M.A Nahian. 
    I am from Bangladesh. 
    I am 15 years old. 
    I am a high school student. 
    I am currently studying in tenth grade at Shamsul Haque Khan School & College, Dhaka.
    <br />
    <br />
    I am a Math enthusiast. 
    Beside my academic studies, I love to solve Mathematical Olympiad problems. 
    Among the four major topics in MO, I like Geometry and Combinatorics (also good at these maybe :p) and I hate NT (obviously because I am weak at this). 
    I have been participating in BdMO (Bangladesh Mathematical Olympiad) since I was 10 years old. 
    I've also participated in some International MO's. 
    Till now, my biggest achievements in MO are getting a Silver at <a href="https://igo-official.com/?p=3225">Iranian Geometry Olympiad 2020</a> and Bronze in <a href="https://ico-official.com/en/2021/advance-result">Iranian Combinatorics Olympiad 2021</a> (team Couldn't Find Any Name). 
    <br />
    <br />
    I also love to code. 
    I am a beginner at competitive programming, but I am trying to improve. 
    Mainly, I started competitive programming to improve my combinatorics skill, but now I do it because I like it. 
    You can check out my cp profile at <a href="https://codeforces.com/profile/Nahian9696">Codeforces</a>, <a href="https://atcoder.jp/users/Nahian9696">AtCoder</a>, <a href="https://www.topcoder.com/members/Nahian9696/">TopCoder</a> and <a href="https://www.codechef.com/users/nahian9696">Codechef</a>. 
    I use C++, Python and Java for cp. 
    Beside competitive programming, I am learning web application development (that's why I have created this website :p). 
    In coding, when I learn something, I try to implement that in any project. 
    So I create new fun projects to implement new stuffs I learn.

    In my free time, I love to play chess on some online platforms (<a href="https://www.chess.com/member/sma-nahian">chess.com</a>, <a href="https://lichess.org/@/SMA-Nahian">lichess</a>, <a href="https://chess24.com/profile/sma-nahian">chess24</a>) and to listen music :p.
