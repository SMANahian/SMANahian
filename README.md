# Hello Everyone! ðŸ‘‹

<p>
Hello! I'm S.M.A Nahian. 
I am from Bangladesh. 
I am 15 years old. 
I am a high school student. 
I am currently studying in tenth grade at Shamsul Haque Khan School & College, Dhaka.
<br />
<br />
I am a Math enthusiast. 
Beside my academic studies, I love to solve Mathematical Olympiad problems. 
Among the four major topics in MO, I like Geometry and Combinatorics (also good at these maybe :p) and I hate NT (obviously because I am weak at this). 
I have been participating in BdMO (Bangladesh Mathematical Olympiad) since I was 10 years old. 
I've participated in some International MO's too. 
Till now, my biggest achievements in MO are getting Silver at <a href="https://www.apmo-official.org/country_report/BGD/2022"> Asian Pacific Mathematics Olympiad 2022 </a> & <a href="https://igo-official.com/">Iranian Geometry Olympiad 2020, 2021</a> and Bronze in <a href="https://ico-official.com/en/2021/advance-result">Iranian Combinatorics Olympiad 2021</a> (team Couldn't Find Any Name). 
<br />
<br />
I also like to code. 
I am a beginner at competitive programming, but I am trying to improve. 
Mainly, I started competitive programming to improve my combinatorics skill, but now I do it because I liked it.

I use C++, Python and Java for cp. 
Beside competitive programming, I am learning web application development (that's why I have created this website :p). 
In coding, when I learn something, I try to implement that in any project. 
So I create new fun projects to implement new stuffs I learn (Like this website).

In my free time, I love to play chess on some online platforms (<a href="https://www.chess.com/member/sma-nahian">chess.com</a>, <a href="https://lichess.org/@/SMA-Nahian">lichess</a>, <a href="https://chess24.com/profile/sma-nahian">chess24</a>) and to listen music (You can follow my playlists on <a href="https://open.spotify.com/user/v8hap9t4lweyw8z23cfsl83hs">Spotify</a> if you like Taylor Swift songs :p ).
